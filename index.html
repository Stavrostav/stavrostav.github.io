    <h1>Stavros Paganos</h1>
    <p>I am 16 years old in 11th grade, and I attend the Academy of Home Education. I've been learning Spanish for three years now and I plan to continue. I also know Greek and Hebrew but want to advance my knowledge in those languages as well.</p>
    <p>I live in New York and I was born in Brooklyn. I do Kung Fu/Wushu on Wednesdays and Fridays (I am a black belt/sash). I also have a cat named Smokey. I am Greek and I have been to biblical cities in Greece such as Corinth. I plan to go to Thessaloniki, Philippi, and the Island of Patmos. I also plan to go to Eretz Yisrael (the Land of Israel), and get baptized in the Jordan River where the Messiah Yeshua (Jesus) was baptized. I can't wait!</p>
    <p>My favorite subject in school is Bible, I love learning about the Holy Bible and all of the amazing content it has. I also love reading God's Word and studying, memorizing, and reciting the Holy Torah. In Messianic Judaism, there is a portion of the Torah that we read every week called the Parashas. On Saturday for Shabbat (the Sabbath), the Haftarah is read. Here is a link for more information about that: <a href="https://torahclub.ffoz.org/torah-portions/">link</a> </p>
    <p>My YouTube channel has many Bible videos, check it out here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz96C8OM1W6kqxK5qVFkylw">link</a> </p>
