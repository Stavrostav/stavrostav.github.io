    <h1>Stavros Paganos</h1>
    <p>I am 16 years old, a junior, and I attend the Academy of Home Education. I've been learning Spanish for three years now and I plan to continue. I also know Greek and Hebrew but want to advance my knowledge in those languages as well.</p>
    <p>I live in New York and I was born in Brooklyn. I do Kung Fu/Wushu on Wednesdays and Fridays (I am a black belt/sash). I also have a cat named Smokey. I am Greek and I have been to biblical cities in Greece such as Corinth. I plan to go to Thessaloniki, Philippi, and the Island of Patmos. I also can't wait to go to Israel!</p>
    <p>My favorite subject in school is Bible. I love reading God's Word and studying, memorizing, and reciting the Holy Torah. I spend a lot of my time learning about the Bible and all of the amazing content it has.</p>
